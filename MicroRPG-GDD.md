### Story
---
Overview:
- The player shouldn't have story shoved down their throat.
- The player should feel like there is subtle hints about this world that might reflect an overarching feeling of the developers.
- The main character is meant to express their alienation to the towns they're helping by expressing their individualism and heroicism.

The protagnoist asks at one point: ***"Why is everyone wearing a mask? I've never worn one myself and... I'm just wondering, are they really all that great?"***</br>
Leading the protagonist to ask some of the villagers questions when interacted with. However the protagonist gets very shallow or ignored when they ask these questions.</br></br>
