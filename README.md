# MicroGame
A collection of the entire codebase of microgames developed.</br></br> They're purely for fun and practice for myself, there was what I'd assumidly call a theory that practising writing a program every day- The same program as you've written before it would improve your skills significantly. While I have no idea if that's true or not. Perhaps in writing multiple microgames I will find the answer to that.

## Game List: (Conceptual Phase)
Micro RPG: Protect the village from forces of evil!
